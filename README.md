## What is Rainbus Toolbox?

Rainbus Toolbox serves as cross-platform alternative to:

- [Limbus Localization UI](https://github.com/x1bViolet/Limbus-Localization-UI)
- [LC Localization Controls](https://github.com/x1bViolet/LC-Localization-Controls)


---

## Features

### Translation [WIP]
- Tools to translate story, statuses, EGO, ID, gifts, and hopefully everything else.

### File Updater [WIP]
- Keeps your localization files in check automatically.
- Adds new entries, formats text, and updates resources after game updates so nothing ends up as "Unknown"

### Battlehint Goober [WIP]
- Modify the game’s battle hints (for now only loading screen ones).
- This tool is separate cuz i like to shit inside battlehints.

### Release Packager
- Packages your localization into a [MTL's launcher](https://github.com/kimght/LimbusLocalizationManager)-ready `.zip`.
- Uploads the release to GitHub with your chosen version and description.
- Optional: Push release info to a Discord channel via webhook.

### Git & Github integration
- In contrast with x1bViolet's tools, this app sees your localization as git repository, allowing you to interact with local and remote.
